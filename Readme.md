The Coffee website project is a dynamic web page that perfectly combines a range of coffee-related features, creating an elegant and interactive experience for users.

The shopping cart feature allows users to add coffee products in different quantities, displaying the total cost. Users can remove products and check the overall cost. The newsletter subscription function validates the email address and shows a confirmation message. As the page is scrolled, animations reveal elements as they enter the viewport. Additionally, the website enables users to copy email addresses by clicking on them.

The search function enables users to search for specific coffee products. By entering a query in the search field, users receive real-time results that match the entered keywords.
