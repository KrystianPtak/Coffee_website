## **Project Description:** This project involves creating a website for a coffee shop that has been designed to be fully responsive, ensuring comfortable browsing on various devices. Here are the key features of this project:

## **Impressive Performance and Optimal Practices**
I would like to start by highlighting the outstanding success of this project. After conducting thorough tests using the Lighthouse Console tool and performing an in-depth website analysis, the results were truly impressive. All key performance indicators related to performance, accessibility, and best SEO practices are looking remarkable, nearing perfection at nearly 100%. I've attached an image showcasing these exceptional results for your reference.

## Navigation and Responsiveness
Clicking on the navigation links smoothly takes users to the relevant sections of the website, regardless of the device they're using. The mobile navigation also closes after clicking a link.

## Product Search
The navigation includes a magnifying glass icon that opens a search field. After searching for a specific coffee, users can click on its description to access detailed information. The search can be closed by clicking the close icon, clicking outside the search field, or pressing the "Escape" key. Any entered text is cleared upon closing.

## "About Us" Section
In the "About Us" section, there's a button that allows users to learn more about the coffee shop's history.

## Coffee Menu
The website features a menu listing the available coffee options. Clicking on a coffee's name takes users to a detailed description, including additional product images.

## "Bestselling Coffee" Section
In this section, users can access more information by clicking "View More." Clicking this button opens a modal with a full description and extra images. Users can add the product to their cart or close the modal by clicking outside, pressing "Escape," or clicking a close button.

## Shopping Cart
Users can add coffees to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button in the "Bestselling Coffee" section. After adding a product, the cart icon updates to display the number of items added. Clicking the cart icon opens a cart panel from the side of the screen. The panel displays the added products, quantities, and individual prices. Each product has a field for adjusting the desired quantity. Changing the quantity updates the product price and the total order amount. Each product in the cart has a trash icon, allowing users to remove items. After removal, the cart panel automatically updates.

## Proceeding to Checkout
Once users have finished selecting products, they can click the "Checkout" button, which leads to a modal containing a purchase form. The modal blocks interaction with the rest of the page, focusing on entering payment details. The form requires contact and payment information. After completing payment and receiving confirmation, the modal closes automatically after 3 seconds. Closing the modal clears all entered data, ensuring user privacy and readiness for the next purchase.

## Data Persistence
To ensure continuity, selected products and quantities are stored in the browser's local storage. This way, even after refreshing or leaving the page, the selected products remain in the cart.

## Blog Section
The "Our Blog" section includes articles. Clicking an article leads users to a page with that specific article.

## Newsletter
Users can input correct email addresses to subscribe to the newsletter. Incorrect or empty addresses trigger messages that automatically disappear after 2 seconds.

## Contact and Map
The contact section includes the store's location. Clicking opens a map with the store's location.

## Email and Phone Interaction
Clicking on the email address or phone number on mobile devices opens the respective application. On desktop, copying content to the clipboard is possible.
