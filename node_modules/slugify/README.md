[![npm-version]][npm] [![coveralls-status]][coveralls]

```js
var slugify = require('slugify')

slugify('some string') // some-string

// if you prefer something other than '-' as separator
slugify('some string', '_')  // some_string
```

- Vanilla ES2015 JavaScript
    - If you need to use Slugify with older browsers, consider using [version 1.4.7](https://github.com/simov/slugify/releases/tag/v1.4.7)
- No dependencies
- Coerces foreign symbols to their English equivalent (check out the [charMap][charmap] for more details)
- Works in the browser (window.slugify) and AMD/CommonJS-flavored module loaders

## Options

```js
slugify('some string', {
  replacement: '-',  // replace spaces with replacement character, defaults to `-`
  remove: undefined, // remove characters that match regex, defaults to `undefined`
  lower: false,      // convert to lower case, defaults to `false`
  strict: false,     // strip special characters except replacement, defaults to `false`
  locale: 'vi',      // language code of the locale to use
  trim: true         // trim leading and trailing replacement chars, defaults to `true`
})
```

## Remove

For example, to remove `*+~.()'"!:@` from the result slug, you can use `slugify('..', {remove: /[*+~.()'"!:@]/g})`.

* If the value of `remove` is a regular expression, it should be a
  [character class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes)
  and only a character class. It should also use the
  [global flag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/global).
  (For example: `/[*+~.()'"!:@]/g`.) Otherwise, the `remove` option might not
  work as expected.
* If the value of `remove` is a string, it should be a single character.
  Otherwise, the `remove` option might not work as expected.

## Locales

The main `charmap.json` file contains all known characters and their transliteration. All new characters should be added there first. In case you stumble upon a character already
